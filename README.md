# Final Project


I tried so hard to get this as close to finished as possible but my mental health got so bad I broke down. So I'm just documenting things here. If anything is missing from the project in any way, shape, or form, this is why. Anything not listed that's also missing from the submission, I couldn't bring myself to attempt.


I tried to implement checking the user's internet connection for my native feature.
First I tried copying the stuff from "https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/platform-integration/communication/networking?view=net-maui-9.0&tabs=android" into the Temperature page, because I wanted the program to be able to check your connection no matter what page you were on in the app. I wanted to have a circle in the top right corner of your screen that would be red if you had no connection, and green otherwise. Then I thought that it should probably be a service, so I made a new service called CheckConnection.cs and moved the code there, but I didn't know what to do with it from there or if I even needed all of it.
